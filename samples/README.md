# Samples

This folder contains sample libraries which demonstrate how to render custom content in foreign processes using HydraHook.

## Available samples

| Sample | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [HydraHook-ImGui](HydraHook-ImGui/) | ImGui-based overlay for DirectX 9, 10, and 11 games |
| [HydraHook-FW1FontWrapper](HydraHook-FW1FontWrapper/) | DirectX 11 text rendering using FW1FontWrapper |

**Note:** On the `rework` branch, samples may be broken due to major API redesign. Build and use samples on the `master` branch for a working reference.
